# Web Design @cmda-minor-web 1920
For this project, the main challenge is applying exclusive, yes exclusive, design patterns to a prototype specifically made for one person with a special requirement. The exclusive design principles are as follows

* Observe situation
* Ignore conventions
* Prioritise identity
* Add nonsense

These principles are laid out to help us see a different side of design and make us always question our habits and patterns.
During this course, each group of students was assigned a person for whom we would create a prototype. In my case, this person was Marijn!

## Who is Marijn?

Marijn describes himself as driven, energetic, analytic and hates people that don't think.

During my 3 prototype test sessions i got to know Marijn as a friendly, witty, intelligent guy who happens to have a motor deficiency, which makes it harder for him to use a keyboard or mouse. He is also a massive nerd and metalhead, so there are plenty of options to create something awesome! Here are some of my notes from my test sessions about Marijn and how he interacts with his macbook

* Shortcut keys to reduce amount of actions, repeated actions can strain Marijn
* Left hand on enter, shift, arrow keys
* Is also used to HJKL from VIM
* Track pad is operated by thumb
* Enlarge click area, but not too much, he can see just fine
* One primary action per screen, split up the action
* Likes retro design, old school nerd style!
* Eindhoven > Amsterdam and back. Monday till tuesday afternoon, plans one hour+ ahead so transit personnel can help him

For this exercise, i chose to develop a better way for Marijn to plan his transit journey from Eindhoven to Amsterdam and back.
Since most datepicker aren't exactly accessible, keeping the user experience as simple as possible will be the key to helping Marijn.

## Test 1 - What's already out there?

For this test, we decided to see how Marijn interacts with the default input types in html. Here are some notes from this test
* Labels are as important as always, as they increase the click-able area and are just good practice
* Is able to navigate the default datepicker quite well, but is not very time efficient
* Marijn is able to use the track-pad well enough, as he uses it to click on the different inputs
* Text inputs however, are quite difficult
* Input fields could be larger
* Plans train journey 1 hour beforehand

## Test 2 - My first prototype
